""" The data structure
A Grid consists of a rectangular, regular, N-dimensional array of data. It contains

    The position of the array cell edges.
    The array data itself.

This is equivalent to knowing

    The origin of the coordinate system (i.e. which data cell corresponds to (0,0,…,0)
    The spacing of the grid in each dimension.
    The data on a grid.

attributes and methods:
    

.grid

    histogram or density, defined on numpy nD array
.edges

    list of arrays, the lower and upper bin edges along the axes (both are output by numpy.histogramdd())
.origin

    cartesian coordinates of the center of grid[0,0,…,0]
.delta

    Either n x n array containing the cell lengths in each dimension, or n x 1 array for rectangular arrays.
.metadata

    a user defined dictionary of arbitrary values associated with the density; the class does not touch metadata[] but stores it with save()
.interpolation_spline_order

    order of interpolation function for resampling; cubic splines = 3 [3]
